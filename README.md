## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?

a. Timely delivery shows the client that you are reliable and thus their trust in you increases leading to future recommendations and being trusted with other future projects. It gives the client satisfaction since expectations were met.
b. It ensures that there is cost efficiency since project management uses a lot of resources whivh may lead to going over the allocated budget causing financial constraints. Delays can also affect the availability of resources and teams required to execute the project.
c. Missing deadlines can lead to legal consequences in scenarios where legal documents were signed prior.
d. In cases of stiff market competition, timely delivery has a high market advantage in comparison with other competitors.

Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by:
a. Proper planning. Ensure the projects objectives and deliverables are well understood. The project can be broken down to small manageable tasks to be executed.
b. Having proper time management. Estimate time that will take to complete the project. Factor in extra time in case there are unexpected issues which may arise.
c. Using project management tools like Trello or Asana to track progress and manage tasks.
d. Ensuring there is proper communication and collaboration between the team members.
e. Identifying potential risks before they occur and come up with strategies to handle the unforseen issues.
f. Regularly reviewing the progress of the project against the allocated timeline.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

Effective cost control:
a. Prevents going overbudget. It ensures that the project sticks within the budget and there is no unnecessary expenditures.
b. Ensures that the project is completed within the allocated time.
c. Maximizes the profits to be made and ensures that there is a return on investment since the project is delivered with minimal waste.
d. Reduces risk of project failure since there is no overspending which can lead to failure of the project.
e. Increases the client's trust since it shows that you exhibit a level of financial discipline. This shows that you are credible and increases chances of getting future funding opportunities.

Strategies to prevent budget overruns
a. Sticking to the allocated time.
b. Coming up with efficient budgets which factor in unforseen and hidden costs which may arise.
c. Assigning tasks to capable people to ensure that they are executed efficiently to prevent the cost which might arise while correcting mistakes.
d. Have a continuous cost tracking and review system to detect if there is any overspending.
e. Encourage team members to be honest, transparent and exhibit financial discipline while working on the project.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile Methodology
a. Follows an incremental and iterative approach.
b. Is highly flexible in terms of allowing changes to be made at any stage.
c. Breaks down the project development lifecycle into sprints.
d. The software product is developed as per the needs of the customer and hence can be changed as per the customer's demands(continuous feedback and collaboration)
e. Testing is done after each sprint.
f. Has a high degree of team coordination.

Waterfall Methodology
a. Follows a linear and sequential approach.
b. Do not allow any changes to be made once a phase is completed.
c. Breaks down the project development lifecycle into distinct phases.
d. Once started, the focus is to complete the project as per the initial requirements.
e. Testing is done only in the test phase.
f. Team coordination is limited.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile Methodology
Good for projects with evolving or unclear requirements, frequent client feedback and those with need for rapid delivery
Examples of projects include software development, in advertising and marketing.

Waterfall Methodology
Good for projects with well defined, stable requirements and with minimal changes.
Examples of projects include in construction and healthcare, pharmaceutical industries

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

a. Have regular code reviews to catch defects early
b. Conduct testings. Test individual components to ensure they function well. Ensure that the integration between different components makes them work properly together. Test the security to identify if there are vulnerabilities and security flaws in the system. Verify that the software meets the requirements and expectations of the users. Assess the system speed, reliability and scalability.
c. Perform regular audits and inspections.
d. Establish clear quality standards and requirements.

 It is important to maintain high standards because:
 a. It ensures client satisfaction.
 b. Reduces maintenance costs.
 c. Allows smooth updates for future enhancements.
 d. It gives a higher market competitive advantage.
 e. It builds client satistfaction and boosts reputability.
 f. Ensures security and compliance since the software is not vulnerable to attcks.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

a. Provides clear objectives and prevents misinterpretation.
b. Helps in allocating the required resources needed to prevent wastage.
c. Allows clear scheduling of tasks to prevent time wastage.
d. Helps in avoiding potential risks that may arise by setting apart clear measures to combat with those issues.
e. Ensures team collaboration since they are able to focuss on priority tasks and have clear guidelines and timelines.

A Work Breakdown Structure is a project management tool that breaks down a project into small manageable tasks, making work easier to plan, execute and track the progress. 
a. It allows for proper organization. 
b. Promotes clear communication and collaboration between team members.
c. Allows clear allocation of tasks so that each team member knows what their responsibility is.
d. Helps in prioritizing tasks to know the priorities.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

a. Improves time management.
b. Allows early detection of risks and ways of managing them.
c. Allows proper collaboration between team members.
d. Helps in tracking the progress of the project.
e. Ensures proper allocation of resources to prevent wastage.

Gantt charts helps in visualising projects making it easier to monitor the progress. They illustrate tasks which depend on others to ensure they are completed in the right order. Can be used to assign milestones to ensure deliverables are completed on time. Help in tracking progress. 

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

I aim to come up with a software that helps patients who need blood connect and match with donors real time helping in dealing with blood shortages. Blood shortage is a common issue in my community. Mostly, people have to do campaigns or to mobilise people when they have patients who are in need of blood.
Also, I want a software that can help patients scan drugs to ensure that they are authentic. There has been a surge of fake products, especially beauty products being sold in the markets.
